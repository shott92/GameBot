# GameBot
a chatbot with two word games - using to learn Tkinter and ttk.

This code is the consequence of trying to learn python
Following some tutorials for some basic command line chatbots, I came up with a wrote 'GameBot'
  A simple command line chat bot, that has two games; eye spy (the answers are either mouse or mirror), and odd one out (answer is Spoon)
from here i want to learn GUI's the programmy part, so writing a basic GUI with;
  1 frame, 2 ttk text widgets, and 2 ttk button widgets

I have my GUI and a programm but although exsisting in the same file they are completely seperate entities.

I am hoping to get the two amalgamated into a single working GameBot, that uses the GUI for input and output,

the top box is intended to be where chatbot responces are displayed as well as the users submitted inputs.
(ideally they would have their own chat bubbles, or appear on different sides of the screen as seen in many chat apps)

tix has also appeared in my research as it would be great to have clickable options for input from a list
such as which game to play, or selecting the odd one out.
